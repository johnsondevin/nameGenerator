# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This is a simple app that displays a randomized name to the screen when the user directs.

I created this app to understand how to use the Android SDK and to better understand the Kotlin language.

Here is a video demonstration of my application and the code behind it.

# Development Environment

To create this application, I used the Android SDK. This enabled me to write the code and design the UI.
The code was written in Kotlin, which is similar to Java.
It is used widely to create applications for Android platforms.

# Future Work

Some things that I would like to continue working on in the future are: 

* Developing a more complex UI. This app uses a very basic design, which works, but is not very attractive to the eye.
I am very interested in creating an app that has more pages, buttons, or anything that would make it more interactive
and attention grabbing.
* Learning how a game could be created using the Android Studio. Before this project, I always 
thought that it would be hard to do something like that, because of the UI. However, after this project, a simple game 
could be created fairly easily.
* Learning how to create an app for a variety of devices. Kotlin can be used for several things, but I would like
to understand how an application could be made for an Apple device, or a mainstream laptop computer. I am not sure
how I would go about creating an app for a laptop, so I am very intrigued by the thought.
